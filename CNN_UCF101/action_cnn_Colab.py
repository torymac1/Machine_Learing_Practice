"""## Example Model

### Some assorted tidbits

Let's start by looking at a simple model. First, note that PyTorch operates on Tensors, which are n-dimensional arrays functionally analogous to numpy's ndarrays, with the additional feature that they can be used for computations on GPUs.

We'll provide you with a Flatten function, which we explain here. Remember that our image data (and more relevantly, our intermediate feature maps) are initially N x C x H x W, where:
* N is the number of datapoints
* C is the number of image channels. 
* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels
* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels

This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we input  data into fully connected affine layers, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a "Flatten" operation to collapse the C x H x W values per representation into a single long vector. The Flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a "view" of that data. "View" is analogous to numpy's "reshape" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).
"""

class Flatten(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        N, C, H, W = x.size() # read in N, C, H, W
        return x.view(N, -1)  # "flatten" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image

"""### The example model itself

The first step to training your own model is defining its architecture.

Here's an example of a convolutional neural network defined in PyTorch -- try to understand what each line is doing, remembering that each layer is composed upon the previous layer. We haven't trained anything yet - that'll come next - for now, we want you to understand how everything gets set up.  nn.Sequential is a container which applies each layer
one after the other.

In this example, you see 2D convolutional layers (Conv2d), ReLU activations, and fully-connected layers (Linear). You also see the Cross-Entropy loss function, and the Adam optimizer being used. 

Make sure you understand why the parameters of the Linear layer are 10092 and 10.

Now it's your job to experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers to train a model that achieves better accuracy on the action recognition **validation** set. You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above.

### Things you should try:
- **Filter size**: Above we used 7x7; this makes pretty pictures but smaller filters may be more efficient
- **Number of filters**: Do more or fewer do better?
- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?
- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?
- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:
    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]
    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]
    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]
- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).
- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.

### Tips for training
For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and regularization strength. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:

- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations
- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.
- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.
- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.

### Going above and beyond
If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these; however they would be good things to try.

- Alternative update steps: For the assignment we implemented SGD+momentum, RMSprop, and Adam; you could try alternatives like AdaGrad or AdaDelta.
- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.
- Model ensembles
- Data augmentation
- New Architectures
  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.
  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.
  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)

If you do decide to implement something extra, clearly describe it in the "Extra Credit Description" cell below.

### What we expect
At the very least, you should be able to train a ConvNet that gets at least 55% accuracy on the validation set. This is just a lower bound - if you are careful it should be possible to get accuracies much higher than that! Extra credit points will be awarded for particularly high-scoring models or unique approaches.

"""### GPU! (This part is optional, 0 points)

If you have access to GPU, you can make the code run on GPU, it would be much faster. 

Now, we're going to switch the dtype of the model and our data to the GPU-friendly tensors, and see what happens... everything is the same, except we are casting our model and input tensors as this new dtype instead of the old one.

If this returns false, or otherwise fails in a not-graceful way (i.e., with some error message), you may not have an NVIDIA GPU available on your machine.
